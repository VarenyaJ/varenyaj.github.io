Subject: Request for Recognition of Bachelor's Degree

Dear Einheitlicher Ansprechpartner Berlin,

I am seeking official recognition of my Bachelor of Science in Integrative Biology from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) to establish its equivalency within the German academic and professional framework. My degree was conferred on December 23, 2024, and I have obtained an official confirmation letter from my university verifying its completion.

The Integrative Biology (BSLAS) program at UIUC is an accredited degree within the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, structured to provide a comprehensive understanding of ecology, evolution, genetics, and organismal biology. The coursework includes phylogenetics, computational biology, genomics, bioinformatics, molecular ecology, and evolutionary development. My degree also includes a Minor in Computational Science and Engineering, which has provided me with expertise in programming, algorithmic data processing, and high-performance computing applications relevant to biological research.

Additionally, I have extensive research experience in bioinformatics, computational biology, and genomics, having worked as a Research Assistant at the Illinois Natural History Survey - Tan Lab of Biodiversity Genomics. My research involved phylogenomic data analysis, including sequence assembly, data extraction, homology assessments, and evolutionary trait analysis. Furthermore, I have experience in metabolomics, proteomics, and data-driven modeling in biological sciences, working with high-throughput sequencing data and genomic data analysis pipelines.

Recognition of this qualification is required for my employment as a Research Assistant/Software Developer at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité (BIH) under Dr. Peter Robinson. I have encountered difficulties initiating the evaluation process with ZAB (Central Office for Foreign Education) to facilitate this recognition. I kindly request guidance on the required documentation and any additional steps necessary to complete my application.

Attached to this request are the following supporting documents:
1. Official Bachelor’s Degree Certificate (eDiploma) from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
2. Degree Completion Confirmation Letter issued by the UIUC Office of Admissions/Records.
3. Curriculum Vitae & Research Experience – A summary of my education, academic projects, and research/work involvement demonstrating the depth and relevance of my qualification.

Please let me know if any further information or additional documents are required. I appreciate your time and assistance in this matter.

Best regards,
